    <h1>Our company has been around for 0 years as it's not an American llc yet. 
    </h1>
    <p>We haven't paid our incorporation fee yet and I don't think we're allowed. We'd have to register under 'american foreign co. first' I think. Best to find some american investors that can register as directors, righy? We want to incoporated in the USA but will need to hire a company law attorney because our directors are defined as 'aliens' at this time.</p>
